<h1>THE OLD GOAT</h1>

<h2>BY CHARLES L. FONTENAY</h2>

<p><i>It's been said that the soul is the<br />
form that makes the body&mdash;which may<br />
just</i> possibly <i>explain what happened<br />
on that fatal day at Ivy College....</i></p>

<p>[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from<br />
Worlds of If Science Fiction, February 1957.<br />
Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that<br />
the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p>Dr. Angstrom was known to his students and many of his colleagues on
the faculty as "The Old Goat." Very appropriate, that name. He had the
disposition of a goat with dyspepsia, he had the cold blue eyes of a
goat, he had the waggling whiskers of a goat. Perhaps it's in memory of
Dr. Angstrom that Ivy College has a goat for its mascot now.</p>

<p>Dr. Angstrom was even more goatish than usual that day last summer when
half a dozen top scientists in the field gathered to see his preview
experiment on matter transmission of a live animal. He had been working
hard for weeks on the transmitter and keeping up classes at the same
time, which did not improve his disposition. Besides, he had a real
goat for an experimental animal, and goats are notoriously hard on the
nervous system.</p>

<p>This particular animal, at the moment the scientists entered, was
straining at his rope, trying to get a mouthful of a tablecloth which
graced a nearby table full of jars and retorts. Failing this, the goat
exhibited that typical lack of discrimination in matters edible and
began to chew on his rope.</p>

<p>I felt a little out of place among all these giant brains. My reason
for being there was that I had been serving, during my college career,
as sort of a factotum and fetch-and-carry man for Dr. Angstrom, and
I was to take notes for him. I had acquired considerable affection
for The Old Goat. Maybe that's one reason I hate to see his great
scientific work kept under wraps because people still insist it's
dangerous.</p>

<p>"I have proved to my own satisfaction that the matter transmitter
works," Dr. Angstrom told the assembled scientists. "I have made a
number of transmissions of inanimate matter. In theory, it should work
just as well for animate objects and I have invited you to be present
at the first test of this theory.</p>

<p>"I need not go into detail with you about the basic theory of matter
transmission. The transmitter itself picks up the atomic and
electronic 'image' of the object inside it, much as a television
scanner picks up a scene, except that it is done in three dimensions
instead of two. This is made possible by the four-dimensional element
which is the heart of the apparatus and was made available to us
through recent intra-atomic research.</p>

<p>"The receiver picks up the image as a television receiver does, except
again in three dimensions. The matter is not duplicated because the
transmitter strips down the object within it as it transmits.</p>

<p>"Now the question that has been raised by some scientists about the
transmission of animate objects is whether the 'soul' or 'life force'
can be transmitted. I consider this question ridiculous, and will prove
it so. It is my contention that such 'life force' is not a thing apart
from the physical shell."</p>

<p>The matter transmitter was a large closed cylinder on one side of the
room. The receiver was a similar cylinder on the other. Both were
raised slightly from the floor.</p>

<p>As sort of <i>hors d'oeuvre</i>, Dr. Angstrom transmitted a large chunk of
lead across the room, then a glass jar. In each case, the object was
placed in the transmitter and a moment later removed from the receiver
across the room. There was no possible way for it to have been moved
across the intervening space except by broadcast transmission.</p>

<p>"As you see," said Dr. Angstrom, "I have eliminated the necessity for
a switch by building the switch into the door of the transmitter. As
soon as the door is closed, transmission occurs. Now we shall send our
animate object."</p>

<p>He untied the goat and, with some difficulty, hauled the animal by its
collar to the transmitter. There the goat balked and Dr. Angstrom,
having got its head through the door, got behind it and shoved
heartily, hanging onto the edge of the door so he could shut it quickly
when the goat was inside.</p>

<p>As goats will, the goat suddenly changed its mind and leaped into the
transmitter. Caught off balance, Dr. Angstrom fell in after it&mdash;and the
door, given a last frantic jerk, slammed on them both.</p>

<p>There were gasps of horror and alarm from the scientists, but I held
up my hand to calm them.</p>

<p>"There's no danger, gentlemen," I said. "It's just as well this way. I
happen to know that Dr. Angstrom's next step, after proving to you with
the goat that animate objects could be transmitted, was to prove that
human beings also could be transmitted. He planned to be his own first
subject."</p>

<p>With serene confidence, I went to the receiver and threw open the door.
Just as I had anticipated, the goat leaped out, unharmed, followed by
Dr. Angstrom.</p>

<p>"I told you animate objects could be transmitted successfully," said
the goat triumphantly.</p>

<p>"Baa!" said Dr. Angstrom, and began eating the tablecloth.</p>

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
